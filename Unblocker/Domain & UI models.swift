/*******************************************************************************
 This program is designed to produce solutions to the puzzles in the Unblock Me
 app, which is available in Apple's App Store.

 The game consists of a 6 x 6 playing board on which are a number of blocks,
 with one block designated as "prisoner."  The prisoner is horizontal and in
 row 2 (where rows and columns are numbered from 0 to 5.)  On the right end
 of row 2 there is an exit from the board (the "escape chute"). The object of
 the game is to release the prisoner  by moving the blocks so that the prisoner
 has a clear path to the escape chute. Horizontal blocks can only move
 horizontally, and vertical blocks can only move vertically.

 In this program, every instance of the Block struct has a fixed, unique ID.
 The properties length, isHorizontal, and isPrisoner are also fixed for a given
 instance.  In addition, there are three variable properties:  col, row, and
 hashValue.

 The column and row define the position of the block in the board, which is
 represented by the position of the block's topmost or leftmost end.

 The hashValue uniquely identifies a particular block at a particular position
 on the board.  Thus the hashValue not only satisfies the definition of "hash
 value" (if two blocks-with-position are equal then their hash values are
 equal), but also can be used to define equality (if two blocks-with-position
 have the same hashValue then they are equal).
