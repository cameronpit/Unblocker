/*******************************************************************************
 Solution is by a breadth-first search. Each node of the queue named q is a
 tuple consisting of a board and a level. The level is the number of moves
 by which the board was reached from initialBoard. To start with, q has just one
 entry, initialBoard at level 0. As the solution progresses, boards are added to
 the bottom of q and other boards are removed from the top of q. Since the
 added boards are in non-decreasing order of level, every possible board at
 level n is dequeued and examined before any board at level n+1.  Therefore a
 solution, if it exists, will eventually be found (provided there is enough
 memory available), and there will be no solution at any lower level.

 The procedure in more detail:

 The method solve() removes a board from the top of the queue (call it
 currentBoard, with level currentLevel) and generates every board which
 can be obtained by moving just one block in currentBoard.  If a generated
 board, call it newBoard, is a key in the dictionary lookUpMoveForBoard[:], then
 newBoard was already encountered earlier (i.e. on a lower level) so it is
 discarded.  Otherwise, the program sets lookupMoveForBoard[newBoard] = move,
 where move is the move which was applied to currentBoard to reach newBoard.
 Then newBoard is added to the bottom of q, with a level of currentLevel + 1.
 Finally, if the most recently moved block is the prisoner block and is adjacent
 to the escape chute, then newBoard is the winning board and the solution has
 been found.  All that remains is to finish setting the properties in var
 solution (which is an instance of struct Solution).
